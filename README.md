## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Focusing on CSS mostly until it comes naturally. Built this project as practice because I've just finished the HTML and CSS courses from W3Schools

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.example.com) - Contains all the HTML, CSS and JS topics you need to learn to start calling yourself a web developer (Personal Opinion)
- [Zach Goll](https://www.example.com) - He understands the problems that a beginner goes through and clarifies all of them.

## Acknowledgments

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JS from Zach Goll's You Tube channel. Amazing guy who explained all concepts clearly and even clarified most of the problems I was facing as a beginner.
